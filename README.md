🎥 Simple Attendance Tracker

This project is a hackathon-friendly attendance tracking web app built with Flask, designed to keep things simple, visual, and easy to explain.

Instead of using a database, the system stores each user in a folder, making attendance easy to see even at file level — perfect for demos and beginner teams.
