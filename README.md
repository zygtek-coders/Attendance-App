# 🎥 Simple Attendance Tracker

A hackathon-friendly attendance tracking web app built with **Flask**, designed to keep things **simple, visual, and easy to explain**.

Instead of using a database, the system stores each user in a folder, making attendance easy to see even at the file level — perfect for demos and beginner teams.
